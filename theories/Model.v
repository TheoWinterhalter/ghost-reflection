(** Injectivity of type formers and constructors in CC

  We assume that the target enjoys injectivity of constructors of inductive
  types and of type formers. We will only state what we need though.
  We take them as axioms to avoid having to develop the full meta-theory of
  CC, which would defeat the purpose of using it as a model.

**)

Axiom ctyval_inj :
  ∀ Γ mk mk' A A' a a',
    Γ ⊢ᶜ ctyval mk A a ≡ ctyval mk' A' a' →
    mk = mk' ∧
    Γ ⊢ᶜ A ≡ A' ∧
    Γ ⊢ᶜ a ≡ a'.


(** Relative consistency **)

Definition cc_consistency :=
  ¬ (∃ t, [] ⊢ᶜ t : cbot).

Definition gtt_consistency :=
  ¬ (∃ t, [] ⊢ t : bot).

Theorem relative_consistency :
  cc_consistency →
  gtt_consistency.
Proof.
  intros hcons. intros [t ht].
  eapply hcons.
  apply param_typing in ht as htp.
  cbn in htp. unfold ptype in htp. cbn in htp.
  eapply validity in ht as h. 2: constructor.
  destruct h as [hs [i h]].
  ttinv h h'. cbn in h'.
  eapply injectivity_Sort in h'.
  remember (md [] t) as m eqn:em in *. clear em. subst.
  cbn in htp.
  eexists. eassumption.
